This converts buildings from passive consumers in a centralized fossil fuel grid to active participants in the emerging distributed energy market.\nSPAN\'s unique commitment to clean-slate ""right architecture"" and our zealotry for top-caliber customer experience position us as domain leaders in envisioning the distributed grid and have allowed us to achieve rapid growth and high visibility in the industry in the two years since we launched.\nThe Role\nWe aim to establish the SPAN panel as the center of home energy and the backbone of the renewable distributed grid.

As Data Scientist, you will leverage your deep understanding of ML, modeling, and statistics to solve problems including anomaly detection, time series forecasting, and event prediction to optimally manage whole-home energy consumption, deliver meaningful insights to the customer, and notify them about a potential failure of equipment or hazards in their home.
